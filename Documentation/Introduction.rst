================================
What does it do?
================================

The Adaptive Profiles is for sensing the clients device screen widht and matching that to a custom profile. The rendering of the page is governed by that profile. This is a way to approach responsive and adaptive designs.

It was specifically developed by Busy Noggin to work with the TemplaVoila Framework extension but can be used with any TYPO3 templating approach.
